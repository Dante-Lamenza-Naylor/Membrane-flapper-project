- time step seems to have little effect on convergence.

- grid resolution has noticeable effect. 
- Error due to singular term increases with increasing grid resolution (getting closer to singularity, something to do with numerical instability at large numbers?)
- Error due to nonsingular term decreases with increasing grid resolution (accuracy of inverse transform for load increases with increase of summands).
